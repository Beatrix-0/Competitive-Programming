# Brian Kernighan's algorithm
We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.
```cpp
int countSetBits(int n)
{
    int count = 0;
    while (n)
    {
        n = n & (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```
