# Left shift, Right shift

## Left shift

Left-shifting a binary number involves moving its bits to the left by a specified number of positions.

In most of the languages, the left shift operator (<<) is used for this operation. The syntax is:

```
result = original_value << num_positions
11 << 2 = 1100 (Binary representation)
```

In binary representation, a left shift operation is equivalent to multiplying a number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.

Example of left shifting: <br>
3 << 2 = 12 (Decimal representation) <br>
3 \* (2 2 ) = 12

## Right shift

Right shifting a binary number involves moving its bits to the right by a specified number of positions.

In most of the languages, the right shift operator (>>) is used for this operation. The syntax is:

```
result = original_value >> num_positions
1100 >> 2 = 11 (Binary representation)
```

n binary representation, a right shift operation is equivalent to dividing a number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.

Example of right shifting: <br>
12 >> 2 = 3 (Decimal representation) <br>
12 / (2 2 ) = 3

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n , pos;
    cin>> n >> pos ;

    // Left shift
    cout << ( n << pos ) << '\n';
    // Right shift
    cout << ( n >> pos ) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
