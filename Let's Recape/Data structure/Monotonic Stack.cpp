Definition: A monotonic stack is a stack used to maintain elements in a strictly increasing or decreasing order, where 
only the top (back) of the stack is accessible for insertion and removal.

Identification:
   Operations: Supports efficient insertion and removal only from the top of the stack (LIFO).
   Order Maintenance: Elements are maintained in a monotonic order (either increasing or decreasing).

Typical Problems:
  -> Next/Previous Greater/Smaller Element 
  -> Largest Rectangle in Histogram
  -> Finding Maximum Area in Binary Matrix
  -> Expression Evaluation :  Checking for balanced parentheses or evaluating the value of an arithmetic expression.

  Complexity: 
    Time/Space Complexity: O(n)
